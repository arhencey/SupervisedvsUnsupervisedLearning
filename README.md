# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning and Principal Component Analysis

This is a project from my graduate Introduction to Machine Learning course at the Univeristy of Tennessee.
In this project, I implemented the clustering algorithms k-means and winner takes all and compared them to the supervised algorithms
Maximum Posterior Probability Cases 1, 2, and 3 and k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, I used k-means to compress an image by reducing
the number of colors in the image. Finally, I implemented Principal Component Analysis for dimentionality reduction.
